# AFL-Dynamic-Bayes-Machine-learning

The scoring and defensive abilities of a football team evolves over time as a result of change of player roster and conditions, or other conditions such as management and available resources. A dynamic model that uses the difference between two Poisson distribution may be usefull in capturing the offensive and defensive talent between two teams.
This model is based on Bayesian Inferences with Markov-Chain-Monte-Carlo to estimate to posterior distribution of the offensive
and defensive talent for each of the team in the AFL. The model is trained on the 2018 season data and validate the next round's result.
